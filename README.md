Free Software 2.0 -- Fair Shareholding (FS Squared)

From Forth and Imgui Android to Free Software Fair Shareholding (FS Squared)

From Forth and Imgui Android to Free Software 2.0

The most important lesson that we can learn from the brief history of free software is perhaps shareholding. That is one essential element in life of a programmer that no experts seem to have any clue. 

Wait! You might scream, isn't free software and shareholding mutually exclusive? Theoretically, perhaps. In hindsight, definitely not.

That's why this article is written to explain the myth of Free Software 2.0 -- free software with fair shareholding -- even the abbreviations coincidentally rhyme. 

The technical difficulties in achieving FS Squared lie in finding a solution that fits in all the following parts:

-- an open online collaborative software development platform that allows programmers to claim the rights to one line of code change;

-- a public key cryptography infrastructure;

-- a common exchange mechanism for cryptocurrencies, fiat currencies and bullions.

Each of the above is a world class problem on its own. Does a solution for all the above exist? That would be a trillion dollars question. The answer is perhaps more significant than the French Revolution, as we enter Industrial Revolution 4.0. This is where our journey begins:

This is a prototype of a stack machine shell (Smashlet) hosted in JavaScript and PHP.

We coined the term "stack machine shell" (Smashlet) in order to categorize and publicize some significant practices in software engineering, which have unfortunately remained relatively unknown outside some inner circles. This is also a rare combination of two not just well known, but almost ubiquitous terms, "stack machine" and "shell", which does not turn up in search results of most search engines!! One wonders if it has been censored, either from the search engines, or the consciousness of mankind.

Smashlet relates to the Forth programming language and other Programming Languages which employ a stack machine interpreter, and it can be implemented in any host programming language, thus making the Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) a universal interface script to all known programming languages. This is possible because we conjecture that there exists a general solution to the inverse of Dijkstra's Shunting Yard Algorithm, which we term, surprisingly the "inverse shunting yard algorithm" (ISYA). Incidentally, Smashlet and RPN lead to a more interesting proposition, that RPN can be used as a universal notation for mathematics as well, thus making the proofs for the hypotheses above representable in RPN and can be evaluated by machines running Smashlet!! 

While there are many interesting issues arising from the discussion above, we will leave them until later, to focus on the more practical aspects of our current project.

The first part of our project is to produce a DJ music mixing app for Android, that can  broadcast live, for users employing a novel anonymous public key cryptography infrastructure.

The audio mixing and http streaming code are available in Google Oboe and Vinyl Cast. The challenge next is to produce a GUI. However, instead of coding the GUI "the conventional way", we will do it the Forth or Smashlet way. 

To be specific, each host programming language function, in C++, Java or others, will be mapped to a "colon definition word" (CDW), the Forth equivalent of function name. 

In this way, authors or programmers can claim ownership to a function, down to an arithmetic operator. Nevertheless, abusing this facility against the spirit of free software is likely to invite boycotts or legal challenges. 

As we have demonstrated above that Smashlet has been implemented in JavaScript and PHP, CDW for C++ or Java code can be "shared live" via http, employing conventional login or our novel anonymous public key cryptography infrastructure. 

Secondly, we can build a "live debugger" on Android using Smashlet. 

Android has been notorious for incompatibility of GNU Linux software development tools although also based on the same Linux kernel. Efforts to bridge the Linux desktop and Android environment have made little progress so far. We believe the Forth or Smashlet way can be the real breakthrough needed. 

Most people have perhaps forgotten how small and simple the first versions of GCC and GDB really were. The MVC "bloatware" Revolution has created the intractable spaghetti software ecosystem that we have today. Forth-ish Smashlet can perhaps revive the old school brute force simplicity. 

Smashlet is essentially a loop that parses space delimited strings into tokens, pushes non-function tokens on to the data stack, and execute functions mapped to by function tokens. The simplest Smashlet loop can be as few as 20 lines of JavaScript code. The same is true of the Forth interpreter. As Smashlet does not necessarily support the common Forth words for various reasons, we have chosen a new name to differentiate from mainstream Forth and derivatives. 

As such, Smashlet can be embedded anywhere of a program with a string input. For Imgui, several instances of the Widgets->Basic can be used. Colon Definition Words (CDW) mapping into C++ or Java functions using Imgui enables programmers to access all internal variables directly LIVE, using the Smashlet shell interface, thus making it a full fledged debugger.
